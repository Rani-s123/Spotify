# Spotify

Creating a "Spotidy" clone using GitHub as the host, and implementing the backend with Node.js and MongoDB involves building a music streaming application inspired by Spotify. Node.js will handle the server-side operations, including user authentication, music catalog management, and API integrations. MongoDB will serve as the database to store user profiles, playlists, and music metadata efficiently. The project will follow stages such as planning, where requirements are defined and initial project setup occurs; design, focusing on creating responsive UI components using HTML, CSS, and possibly a front-end framework like React; implementation, where Node.js and Express.js set up the backend APIs and integrate with MongoDB for data storage; testing to ensure functionality and resolve any bugs; and deployment on GitHub Pages for front-end hosting and services like Heroku for backend deployment. This internship project provides valuable experience in full-stack development, emphasizing Node.js for server-side operations, MongoDB for data storage, and GitHub for version control and hosting.
